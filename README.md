#### About
Hello Everyone! I’m Kusino, a graduate of the Medical Records and Health Information Diploma from Poltekkes Kemenkes Tasikmalaya. I’ve had the opportunity to gain clinical experience at several healthcare facilities, including RS Sumber Waras, Puskesmas Palimanan, RSUD Prof. Dr. Margono Soekarjo, RSUP Dr. Hasan Sadikin Bandung, and RS Ciremai.

I specialize in collaborating with healthcare teams, managing time effectively, and ensuring accuracy in all tasks. My expertise includes electronic medical record management, health data analysis, coding (ICD), and maintaining strict patient confidentiality. Additionally, I’m proficient in utilizing hospital information systems (SIMRS), and I am eager to contribute as a dedicated and reliable Medical Records professional, fully committed to improving healthcare service quality.

I am open to new opportunities in healthcare service facilities. Feel free to contact me at kusino72@gmail.com for potential collaborations or job opportunities.
