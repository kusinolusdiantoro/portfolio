Hello Everyone! I’m Kusino, a graduate of the Medical Records and Health Information Diploma from Poltekkes Kemenkes Tasikmalaya. I’ve had the opportunity to gain clinical experience at several healthcare facilities, including RS Sumber Waras, Puskesmas Palimanan, RSUD Prof. Dr. Margono Soekarjo, RSUP Dr. Hasan Sadikin Bandung, and RS Ciremai.

I specialize in collaborating with healthcare teams, managing time effectively, and ensuring accuracy in all tasks.
